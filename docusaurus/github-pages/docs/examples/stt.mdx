# A Fancy UI for a Text Adventure? Blame Chrome's STT!

And yes, I did build a UI. I know what you're thinking... Buddies, we’re in the land of 
Text Adventures! What could a UI possibly look like here? Well, it’s about as fancy as a 
text-based UI can get, but it's all for a good reason: I wanted to use Chrome’s 
Speech-to-Text (STT) engine. Whisper may be amazing, but Chrome’s STT is the true 
underdog—responsive, precise, and shockingly good for something that's basically free. 
And since we're already relying on an LLM, offline isn’t exactly a requirement here.
