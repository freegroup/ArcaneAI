# Solutions

Modern text-based games must contain not only decent storytelling and writing, but they must also do the following:


- Implement game mechanics that are more complex than just '_a man goes through some rooms and examines things_'
- Have at least one compelling NPC with opportunities to chat and opportunities to establish a relationship
- Offer natural language processing (it's a text-based game so one of the main tasks is to process text, surprisingly for most interactive fiction authors)



A text-based game that understands `hello` but can't understand `hello, how are you? Do you like me?` fails one of the main tasks of a text-based game â€“ text processing. It was acceptable 30 years ago but now you need something more to impress players.

And this is where AI can be a wonderful ally. As mentioned before, not everyone is a Hemingway, and thatâ€™s exactly where AI can lend a helpful hand â€“ or rather, a helpful processor. AI can help craft natural dialogue, enhance storytelling, and make those NPCs truly engaging. Not only that, but when it comes to natural language processing, AI is the perfect companion. It lets you focus on what really matters: crafting great stories and designing clever puzzles.

And let's face it, even the best writers could use a little help to make sure their NPCs don't sound like a broken record from the 80s. ðŸ˜‰
