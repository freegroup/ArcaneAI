# The Creative Process and Challenges

Every creative process has its quirks. Sometimes, you come up with a solution without any clue what problem 
it's meant to solve. Well, I had one of those moments. I paired a large language model (LLM) with a state engine, 
just to see if it would work. Of course, it worked—it's not rocket science. But seeing it live? Somehow, it felt a bit like magic.

Then it hit me: perfect for a text adventure! Suddenly, I could walk through rooms, explore environments - the whole thing felt quite brilliant. 
But here's the catch: I'm a computer scientist, not Hemingway. That's where the LLM stepped in again. I set the plot and mood, and the LLM 
handled the Hemingway part.

I come up with the puzzles, and Hemingway - uh, I mean the LLM - does the rest. And that, my friends, is how you create a solution that 
suddenly gives you a whole new problem to solve.

## Writing Challenges
Text-based adventures usually involve a lot of text, and let's face it, we're probably not Hemingways. You need good writing, a good plot, interesting characters, and of course, engaging mechanics to drive the game forward. Many existing games either have a good plot but terrible writing, or dull mechanics, or they have well-written text but completely banal content. Take a look at some games on popular websites—you will quickly understand what I mean.
