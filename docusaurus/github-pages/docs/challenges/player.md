# Enhancing the Player Experience
If you want to reach a broader community, you need more than just text. You need something that enhances the player experience - whether it's sound effects, background music, or even voice-over, so players can immerse themselves more deeply in the atmosphere. This can make a significant difference, especially for visually impaired players. In my approach, I want to ensure that this target group can dive into the story just as intensively as sighted players.

## AI Integration for Realistic Characters
The integration of an AI-based engine is also intended to help make the character feel more real, allowing the player to build a deeper relationship with them. The dialogues should not just feel predetermined and dull - the freedom for characters to respond flexibly and naturally to input creates a completely different emotional depth. At the same time, the game itself remains guided: it is not a completely open AI game where the challenge is solely to understand the AI. The plot, puzzles, and mood are determined by the author's guidelines. This ensures that the story remains a shared experience that players can discuss with each other and that fosters community-buildingâ€”rather than everyone having a completely different journey.
