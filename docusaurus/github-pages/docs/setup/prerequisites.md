# Prerequisites
...so, if your curiosity has been piqued and youâ€™ve been hunting for a <span class="color">"Try it out"</span> button... sorry, not here. Running an LLM for everyone is just too expensive for us normal folks. But donâ€™t worry, Iâ€™ll show you how to get it running locally. Thereâ€™s just one small hurdle... but hey, consider it the first step in your text adventureâ€”obtain the key! Yes, just like in a classic adventure game, but instead of a rusty old key, you'll need an API key from OpenAI to summon GPT-4. ðŸ˜‰

There are two versions: a console version and a UI version. The UI version comes with Chromeâ€™s great speech-to-text feature, but for getting started, the console version is just perfect.



- <span class="color">Console Version</span>: The console version can run with user input or voice input by using different Speech-to-Text (STT) engines like Whisper, Faster Whisper, or Google STT.
- <span class="color">Web Version</span>: The web version uses the highly advanced Speech-to-Text engine of the Google Chrome browser, which is powered by a Google backend.


The prerequisites are required for either the bash version and for the Web version

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/freegroup/ArcaneAI.git
cd ArcaneAI

```

### Install Python 3.12.7 and Dependencies

Other versions may work as well, but this is tested and works perfectly.

```bash
# Go into the ./game directory to prepare the Python environment
cd game 

# Create a virtual environment to keep the global environment clean
python3.12 -m venv venv 

# Activate the virtual environment
source ./venv/bin/activate  

# Install required libraries
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### An API Key for Your Preferred LLM

Due to the use of `function calling`, the only fully working LLM for now is OpenAI GPT-4o. Other models may work with adjustments to the prompt, but as of now, they require more tweaking, and I haven't gotten them running yet.

I use a `.env` file or environment variables to expose API keys for the different LLM and TTS providers. Letâ€™s create one and configure it:

Create a file `./game/.env` with the following content:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=#############your-key##########

# Uncomment and set up additional API keys if needed.
# By default, this project uses OpenAI only.
#
#GEMINI_API_KEY=#####gemini-key##################
#GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=./secrets/gen-lang-client-#############.json

# info, debug, error, fatal
ARCANEAI_LOG_LEVEL=info

# Configuration for the web UI
#
MAP_FILE=TheTipsyQuest
USERNAME=<username>
PASSWORD=<password>

```


now you are ready to run a demo setup...
