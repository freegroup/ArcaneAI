_Enter a world where classic text adventures meet the cutting edge of AI._

Welcome to the **AI-Powered Text Adventure Engine**, a modern twist on classic interactive fiction like _Zork_ (originally released in **1980**). Imagine if a **state engine** from the golden age of gaming and a **Large Language Model (LLM)** like GPT had a child‚Äîthis project is that child.

The engine dynamically generates engaging narratives, custom-tailored to your journey through a world of interconnected rooms, characters, and puzzles. By merging the deterministic logic of a state machine with the creativity of an AI, the result is an adventure that's both structured and limitless.
