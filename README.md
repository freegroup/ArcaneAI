# 🕹️ AI-Powered Text Adventure Engine

![Game Screenshot](./images/screnshoot.png)  
_Enter a world where classic text adventures meet the cutting edge of AI._

Welcome to the **AI-Powered Text Adventure Engine**, a modern twist on classic interactive fiction like _Zork_ (originally released in **1980**). Imagine if a **state engine** from the golden age of gaming and a **Large Language Model (LLM)** like GPT had a child—this project is that child.

The engine dynamically generates engaging narratives, custom-tailored to your journey through a world of interconnected rooms, characters, and puzzles. By merging the deterministic logic of a state machine with the creativity of an AI, the result is an adventure that's both structured and limitless.

## 🚀 Features
- **State-Driven Gameplay**: Every "room" or "state" dynamically defines the story, puzzles, and actions available.
- **LLM-Driven Storytelling**: An intelligent narrative adapts to your decisions and deepens immersion.
- **Modular Prompts**: Game-specific prompts frame the AI responses, keeping the story coherent and aligned with the adventure's theme.
- **Drag-and-Drop State Engine**: Build and modify game states, rooms, and puzzles with an intuitive drag-and-drop interface.
- **Graphics State Engine**: Visualize the structure of your adventure world with a graphical representation of interconnected states.
- **Prompt Editor for Storytelling**: Fine-tune the AI's narrative by customizing prompts and dialog directly in an integrated editor.
- **Infinite Possibilities**: Extend the game world with new states, rooms, or narrative prompts.
