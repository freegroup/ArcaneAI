# üïπÔ∏è ArcaneAI - Text Adventure Engine
> "Because without 'AI' in the name, no one would venture into our dungeon of clicks... Yes, we too have succumbed to the dark path of clickbait. But hey, an adventure is an adventure, even for algorithms!"

_Enter a world where classic text adventures meet the cutting edge of AI._

Welcome to the **AI-Powered Text Adventure Engine**, a modern twist on classic interactive fiction like _Zork_ (originally released in **1980**). Imagine if a **state engine** from the golden age of gaming and a **Large Language Model (LLM)** like GPT had a child‚Äîthis project is that child.

The engine dynamically generates engaging narratives, custom-tailored to your journey through a world of interconnected rooms, characters, and puzzles. By merging the deterministic logic of a state machine with the creativity of an AI, the result is an adventure that's both structured and limitless.


## üöÄ Features
- **State-Driven Gameplay**: Every "room" or "state" dynamically defines the story, puzzles, and actions available.
- **LLM-Driven Storytelling**: An intelligent narrative adapts to your decisions and deepens immersion.
- **Modular Prompts**: Game-specific prompts frame the AI responses, keeping the story coherent and aligned with the adventure's theme.
- **Drag-and-Drop State Engine**: Build and modify game states, rooms, and puzzles with an intuitive drag-and-drop interface.
- **Graphics State Engine**: Visualize the structure of your adventure world with a graphical representation of interconnected states.
- **Prompt Editor for Storytelling**: Fine-tune the AI's narrative by customizing prompts and dialog directly in an integrated editor.
- **Infinite Possibilities**: Extend the game world with new states, rooms, or narrative prompts.

# ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer: A Playground, Not a Product!
Welcome, brave adventurer! Just to set expectations: ArcaneAI is a magical playground, not yet a polished game engine ready for battle. It's a place where experiments thrive, where algorithms impress even their own creators, and where the fun lies in exploring what works (and what doesn‚Äôt). It‚Äôs surprising, intriguing, joyful, and definitely inspiring... but it's not a finished product. So grab your sword of curiosity, roll the dice of creativity, and enjoy the ride!
