You need something that enhances the player experience - whether it\'s sound effects, background music, or even voice-over, so players can immerse themselves more deeply in the atmosphere. This can make a significant difference, especially for visually impaired players. In my approach, I want to ensure that this target group can dive into the story just as intensively as sighted players.","sidebar":"sidebar"},"examples/mood":{"id":"examples/mood","title":"Mood","description":"Can AI have emotions? Not really, but it can act like it does! Watch as we pair a State Engine with ChatGPT, using clever prompts to control its mood. The twist?

Okay, okay, maybe it\'s not that thrilling if you\'re a programmer or a hacker... but still, this post describes the journey from a simple experiment with an LLM, to incorporating a StateEngine, and eventually transforming it into a full-fledged text adventure game engine. It\u2019s a tale of pushing boundaries, adding complexity, and finding unexpected fun in the process.","sidebar":"sidebar"},"setup":{"id":"setup","title":"Setup","description":"...so, if your curiosity has been piqued and you\u2019ve been hunting for a \\"Try it out\\" button... sorry, not here.

There\u2019s just one small hurdle... but hey, consider it the first step in your text adventure\u2014obtain the key! Yes, just like in a classic adventure game, but instead of a rusty old key, you\'ll need an API key from OpenAI to summon GPT-4. \ud83d\ude09","sidebar":"sidebar"},"solutions":{"id":"solutions","title":"Solutions","description":"Modern text-based games must contain not only decent storytelling and writing, but they must also do the following:","sidebar":"sidebar"},"tale":{"id":"tale","title":"The Tale of an LLM Wrangler","description":"It all began innocently, with the idea of giving an LLM its own mood\u2014like a morning grump who refuses to cooperate until it gets its coffee. Imagine our hero, a coder, sitting at a computer late at night, lit only by the green glow of a terminal screen. The goal? To play around with Large Language Models (LLMs). Why? Because it\u2019s fun to see an AI make sense of your code and spit out something delightful. Who could resist a few late - night experiments with an eager AI?","sidebar":"sidebar"}}}}')}}]);
