    </div>
    <div class="section">
        <p>
            This post is a summary of my thoughts on the development of text adventure engine, particularly with regard 
            to the challenges and problems associated with them.

        <h2 class="title">The Creative Process and Challenges</h2>
        <p>
            Every creative process has its quirks. Sometimes, you come up with a solution without any clue what problem 
            it's meant to solve. Well, I had one of those moments. I paired a large language model (LLM) with a state engine, 
            just to see if it would work. Of course, it worked—it's not rocket science. But seeing it live? Somehow, it felt a bit like magic.
        </p>
        <p>
            Then it hit me: perfect for a text adventure! Suddenly, I could walk through rooms, explore environments—the whole thing felt quite brilliant. 
            But here's the catch: I'm a computer scientist, not Hemingway. That's where the LLM stepped in again. I set the plot and mood, and the LLM 
            handled the Hemingway part.
        </p>
        <p>
            I come up with the puzzles, and Hemingway—uh, I mean the LLM—does the rest. And that, my friends, is how you create a solution that 
            suddenly gives you a whole new problem to solve.

        <h2 class="title">Text-Based Adventures: The Writing Challenges</h2>
        <p>
            Text-based adventures usually involve a lot of text, and let's face it, we're probably 
            not Hemingways. You need good writing, a good plot, interesting characters, and of course, 
            engaging mechanics to drive the game forward. Many existing games either have a good plot 
            but terrible writing, or dull mechanics, or they have well-written text but completely banal 
            content. Take a look at some games on popular websites—you will quickly understand what I mean.
        </p>

        <h2 class="title">Enhancing the Player Experience</h2>
        <p>
            If you want to reach a broader community, you need more than just text. You need something that 
            enhances the player experience—whether it's sound effects, background music, or even voice-over, 
            so players can immerse themselves more deeply in the atmosphere. This can make a significant 
            difference, especially for visually impaired players. In my approach, I want to ensure that this 
            target group can dive into the story just as intensively as sighted players.

    <div class="section">
        <h2 class="title">AI Integration for Realistic Characters</h2>
        <p>
            The integration of an AI-based engine is also intended to help make the character feel more 
            real, allowing the player to build a deeper relationship with them. The dialogues should 
            not just feel predetermined and dull—the freedom for characters to respond flexibly and naturally 
            to input creates a completely different emotional depth. At the same time, the game itself 
            remains guided: it is not a completely open AI game where the challenge is solely to understand 
            the AI. The plot, puzzles, and mood are determined by the author's guidelines. This ensures 
            that the story remains a shared experience that players can discuss with each other and that 
            fosters community-building—rather than everyone having a completely different journey.

        <h2 class="title">The Intended Audience</h2>
        <p>
            Who is the intended audience for these games? Just like any other genre, you have three main groups of players
            :</p>
        <h3 class="subtitle">1. The game's creator</h3>
        <p>
            It's not as bad as you may think (or even as bad as I think). As a software developer, I'm quite used to 
            writing software just for myself. Just take a look at my GitHub repos... Some writers create their 
            stories just to read them for themselves after a year or so. 
            Art created for a single person is still art.
        </p>
        <h3 class="subtitle">2. Other creators in the same genre</h3>
        <p>
            The interactive fiction community is the best example here: they use similar tools, write their 
            own games, and play each other's games. It can be a pretty closed community at times.
        </p>
        <h3 class="subtitle">3. The usual gamers</h3>
        <p>
            Yeah... the usual gamers... millions of players...
        </p>
        <p>
            Do you have awesome pixel art landscapes to impress them? A killer soundtrack? Amazing voice 
            acting? Most of the time, no.
        </p>
        <p>
            You have text. The player types some text as input, and your game responds with some text as output.
        </p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="section">
        <h2 class="title">The Biggest Challenges</h2>
        <h3 class="subtitle">1. Outdated Text Processing</h3>
        <p>
            Most traditional text adventures fail at basic input. The engine understands 'go north,' but not 'let's go north.' 
            Such limitations make it difficult to maintain immersion. In my approach, natural language processing should be a 
            central element so that the game can also handle more complex phrasing and keep interactions smooth. It's a 
            text-based game, and one of the main tasks is to process text. A game that understands 'hello' but can't 
            process 'hello, how are you?' is missing a critical component.
        </p>
        <h3 class="subtitle">2. Simple Gameplay Mechanics</h3>
        <p>
            Many older frameworks for interactive fiction rely on simple mechanics like four directions (north, south, east, west) 
            and the usual "examine this, examine that." My goal is to create more depth—both in terms of interacting with the 
            environment and in terms of the player's ability to move through the world.
        </p>
        <h3 class="subtitle">3. Characters with Depth</h3>
        <p>
            A key point of my idea is that characters are not just narrative devices but real, tangible personalities with 
            their own thoughts, feelings, and secrets. The ability to interact with them in natural conversations and build 
            real relationships is a crucial aspect of the experience. Players should be able to empathize with the characters, 
            laugh with them, cry with them, and seek solutions together in difficult situations.
        </p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="section">
        <h2 class="title">Summary</h2>
        <p>In summary, I want to create a game that:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Features complex mechanics that go far beyond simple movement and examination</li>
            <li>Provides characters that are real personalities with whom the player can build relationships</li>
            <li>Integrates natural language processing to ensure an authentic player experience</li>
            <li>Includes sound and voice-over to enhance the atmosphere and provide an intense experience for visually impaired players as well</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The goal is to tell a story so compelling that players talk not only about the game itself but also about the shared journey they experienced—whether it's solving a puzzle or exploring relationships with the characters. It's not just about moving from room to room, but about experiencing a deep, emotional, and thrilling story together.</p>
